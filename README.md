The Quick Sort algorithm is an efficient and very popular sorting algorithm used in many situations due to its high efficiency(time(ONlogN) and space complexities(logN)), and its divide and conquer approach.

Here we visualize it using bars in form of rectangles.

Language: C.
Programming Paradigm: Function based.
Concepts: Recursions
Libraries: SDL2(for visualization) only.
